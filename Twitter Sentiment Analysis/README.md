### Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Objective : We will try to see the overall sentiments of people for a popular television program - WWE SmackDown Live which is also referred as SDLive. We are going to do this analysis based on tweets from Twitter.

We will be working on four different files:

positive.txt - contains positive words

negative.txt - contains negative words

stop.txt - contains stop words

SDLive.txt - contains the tweets for SDLive

Open the files for reading, then read and split them to get individual words.

We will also need to convert all the words in SDLive.txt into lower case for appropriate comparison.
